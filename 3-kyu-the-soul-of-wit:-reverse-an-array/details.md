# The soul of wit: reverse an array

[@codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b81886460387d8fc000043)

No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use `Array.prototype.reverse`.

You have 47 bytes to spare.

Example: `[1, 2, 3]` â†’ `[3, 2, 1]`

And this time you won't be able to do the *thing* from [that kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reverse-it-quickly).

`require`, `import` and `from` aren't allowed as well.
